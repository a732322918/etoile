Étoilé 0.4.0 Release Announcement
=================================

Étoilé intends to be an innovative GNUstep based user environment built from the ground up on highly modular and light components with project and document orientation in mind, in order to allow users to create their own workflow by reshaping or recombining provided Services (aka Applications), Components etc. Flexibility and modularity on both User Interface and code level should allow us to scale from PDA to computer environment.

0.4 is a developer-targeted release on its way towards this goal.  As a developer-focussed release, this predominantly consists of frameworks.  A few demonstration applications are also included.  More will be added during the 0.4.x release series, leading to a user-focussed 0.5 release next year.

Highlights
----------

*EtoileFoundation* is the core framework for all Étoilé projects, providing numerous convenience methods on top of the OpenStep foundation and significantly better support for reflection.  This includes *EtoileThread* which allows objects to transparently be run in a separate thread.

*CoreObject* is a framework for describing model objects, complete with metadata and automatic versioning and persistence.  It uses the EtoileSerialize framework which, in many cases, allows objects to be automatically serialized with no extra code being written.

*EtoileUI* allows data-centric user interfaces to be easily created by applying styles to models from CoreObject.  It exposes the same interfaces as other CoreObject systems, allowing the user interface to be introspected and modified just like any other model.

*LanguageKit* is a compiler kit built on top of LLVM for creating dynamic language implementations using an Objective-C runtime for the object model.  This is used by *SmalltalkKit*, implementing Étoilé's Pragmatic Smalltalk, a Smalltalk JIT compiler which generates code binary-compatible with Objective-C, allowing classes to be written in a mixture of Smalltalk and Objective-C.

Other frameworks, such as *LuceneKit*, providing full-text indexing and searching, and *OgreKit*, a powerful regular expression framework are also included.  

Several applications are part of this release, such as *Mélodie*, a music jukebox using CoreObject for the music library and *MediaKit* for playback.  Étoilé applications which use *ScriptKit* are scriptable from outside using Objective-C or Smalltalk.  This is used by the hit corners and gesture recognition tool to run arbitrary commands in response to corner activations or mouse gestures, and by *ScriptServices* which allows arbitrary shell or Smalltalk scripts to be invoked on the current selection from any GNUstep or Étoilé application.
