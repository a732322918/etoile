Étoilé 0.4.0 Release Announcement =================================

Étoilé intends to be an innovative GNUstep based user environment built from
the ground up on highly modular and light components with project and document
orientation in mind, in order to allow users to create their own workflow by
reshaping or recombining provided Services (aka Applications), Components etc.
Flexibility and modularity on both User Interface and code level should allow
us to scale from PDA to computer environment.

0.4 is a developer-targeted release on its way towards this goal.  As a
developer-focussed release, this predominantly consists of frameworks.  A few
demonstration applications are also included.  More will be added during the
0.4.x release series, leading to a user-focussed 0.5 release next year.

Highlights ----------

*EtoileFoundation* is the core framework for all Étoilé projects, providing
numerous convenience methods on top of the OpenStep foundation and
significantly better support for reflection.  This includes *EtoileThread*
which allows objects to transparently be run in a separate thread.  It also
includes a number of extensions to the Objective-C object model, allowing
traits and mixins.  This framework is used by most of the rest of Étoilé and
provides a number of core functions, such as UUID and XML handling.

*CoreObject* is a framework for describing and organizing model objects.  It
supports automatic persistence and versioning by recording messages sent to
objects. It offers a flexible versioning scheme where both individual objects
and their entire object graph can be versioned  separately. The built-in object
model is a generalization of the  property model used by the AddressBook
framework.  Foreign model objects can be also integrated by wrapping them with
a special proxy.  CoreObject uses the *EtoileSerialize* framework which, in many
cases, allows objects and messages to be automatically serialized with no
extra code being written.

*EtoileUI* allows data-centric user interfaces to be easily created by applying
styles to models from CoreObject.  It exposes the same interfaces as other
CoreObject systems, allowing the user interface to be introspected and modified
just like any other model.  This is a preview release and should not be
considered stable.  

*LanguageKit* is a compiler kit built on top of LLVM for creating dynamic
language implementations using an Objective-C runtime for the object model.
This is used by *SmalltalkKit*, implementing Étoilé's Pragmatic Smalltalk, a
Smalltalk JIT compiler which generates code binary-compatible with Objective-C,
allowing classes to be written in a mixture of Smalltalk and Objective-C.

Other frameworks, such as *LuceneKit*, providing full-text indexing and
searching, and *OgreKit*, a powerful regular expression framework are also
included.  *UnitKit* is a simple and flexible unit testing framework used by much of Étoilé.  A new addition is *MediaKit*, a framework used to provide support for sound playback and recording and, in future, video.  *SystemConfig* has received a number of improvements since our last release, including support for modifying X11 keyboard layouts and monitoring the battery level.

Several applications are part of this release, such as *Mélodie*, a music
jukebox using CoreObject for the music library and *MediaKit* for playback.
Étoilé applications which use *ScriptKit* are scriptable from outside using
Objective-C or Smalltalk.  This is used by the hit corners and gesture
recognition tool to run arbitrary commands in response to corner activations or
mouse gestures, and by *ScriptServices* which allows arbitrary shell or
Smalltalk scripts to be invoked on the current selection from any GNUstep or
Étoilé application.
