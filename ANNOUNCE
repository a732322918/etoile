Étoilé 0.2.0 Released
=====================

July 28, 2007:

The Étoilé project is pleased to announce the release of version 0.2 of the
Étoilé User Environment for UNIX-like systems.  The Étoilé project aims to
produce a user environment for desktop and small form-factor devices, with
tight integration between components.  The 0.2 release is primarily targeted at
developers interested in a GNUstep-based environment.  

This release includes improvements to the Camaelon theme engine, providing a
clean and modern appearance to GNUstep-based applications.  This is combined
with the Étoilé Menu Server, providing a horizontal menu bar similar to that
found in Mac OS.  

The 0.2 release includes a number of new frameworks, including support for
OPML, RSS, and a number of enhancements to the core OpenStep APIs for better
integration with the Étoilé environment.

Usability improvements include the addition of hot corners, allowing arbitrary
scripts to be run when the pointer enters a screen corner, and numerous
improvements to the window manager (Azalea) and dock.  This release includes a
set of core services (applications), including a rich text editor, drawing
tool, RSS reader and IM client.

The next release is intended to focus on improving the user experience and
integrating some of the core components needed for a full Étoilé environment,
including a greater focus on component and project orientation, and a
de-emphasis on applications.

Étoilé 0.2 requires the latest stable release of GNUstep.  If your operating
system or distribution packages an older version, you may need to upgrade.
