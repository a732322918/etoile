About Étoilé
------------

Étoilé is an independent project of various people like developers, artists and 
other wanderers to create an open source and innovative GNUstep based Desktop 
Environment. 
More precisely, it intends to be a user environment built from the ground up 
on highly modular and light components with project and document orientation in 
mind, in order to allow users to create their own workflow by reshaping or 
recombining provided Services (aka Applications), Components etc. Flexibility 
and modularity on both User Interface and code level should allow it to scale 
from PDA to computer environment.
