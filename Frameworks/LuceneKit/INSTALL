LuceneKit INSTALL
=================

Required software
-----------------

You need to have the GNUstep core libraries installed in order to
compile and use LuceneKit. The core packages are, at a minimum:

   * gnustep-make

   * gnustep-base

See <http://www.gnustep.org/> for further information.

You also need to have zlib library installed:
    
    * zlib 
    
See <http://www.zlib.net/> for further information.

You also need OgreKit, which can be found in Etoile/Frameworks/OgreKit. This
dependency is automatically handled when LuceneKit is built by running
'make' tool in Frameworks or any other parent directories.


Build and Install
-----------------

   Steps to build:

   * make install
   

Required software (Mac OS X / Cocoa)
------------------------------------

   * Xcode or gnustep-make

Take note it is supported to rely on GNUstep build system (known as 
gnustep-make) to build LuceneKit against Cocoa. See <http://www.gnustep.org/> 
for further information.

You also need to have zlib library installed:
    
    * zlib
