UnitKit (GNUstep) NEWS
======================

1.1
---

    * Updated UnitKit 1.0 GNUstep port to UnitKit 1.1 source code
    
    * Fixed new Cocoa specific code in UnitKit 1.1 (to have proper GNUstep 
    support)
    
    * Added two delegate methods -initForTest and -releaseForTest which makes a 
    lot easier custom initializations for objects to test (by avoiding to 
    duplicate such code across many tests). -initForTest and -releaseForTest are 
    similar to JUnit -setUp and -tearDown methods


1.0
